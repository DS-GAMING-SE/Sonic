## Nodes

### Main
This is the node in which all your other nodes in the end link to. It has several inputs that all serve different purposes.

The animated images below show all of the inputs and how they behave when changed over time.
Most of them animate back and forth between 0 and 1 (Black and White)


---


### Diffuse
![](.images/main_input_diffuse.gif)
This is the main color of your shaders. The diffuse color will receive light, have light falloff depending on the light-normal angle, and be shaded by shadows.

---


### Diffuse Power
![](.images/main_input_diffusepower.gif)
This is the exponent of the falloff of the light-normal angle. Can be used to get an extra metallic look when using values above 1. Note that this does not currently conserve energy, whenever that is enabled.

---



### Specular
![](.images/main_input_specular.gif)
This is the color of the specular highlights of your shader. Higher values are brighter, black will not affect the shader at all.

---



### Gloss
![](.images/main_input_gloss.gif)
This is the exponent of the specular highlights. Higher values will make it look shiny, values approaching 0 will make it look matte. Note that if you have unchecked gloss remapping, you should avoid using gloss values below 1.



---

### Normal
![](.images/main_input_normal.gif)
This is the tangent-space normal direction, where you can connect normal maps or custom normal vectors.



---

### Emission
![](.images/main_input_emission.gif)
This is simply light that is always added to your shader, regardless of the lighting conditions.



---

### Transmission
![](.images/main_input_transmission.gif)
This controls how much light is passed through when the light source is behind the surface currently being rendered. This can be useful for thin materials such as cloth or vegetation.



---

### Light Wrapping
![](.images/main_input_lightwrapping.gif)
This is a way of controlling the light-normal angle falloff offset, which can be used to get an effect similar to subsurface scattering. Works best for smooth objects. Inputting a red-ish value will make the red channel "wrap around" the object more than the others, making it look as if light passed into the mesh, and came out with a red wavelength, similar to how skin is shaded.



---

### Diffuse Ambient Light
![](.images/main_input_diffuseambientlight.gif)
This adds light to your shader, affected by your diffuse. Can be used with, for example, cubemap using the normal direction for image-based lighting (IBL), or ambient light



---

### Specular Ambient Light
![](.images/main_input_specularambientlight.gif)
This adds light to your shader, affected by your specular. Can be used with, for example, a cubemap using the view reflection direction for image-based lighting (IBL)



---

### Diffuse Ambient Occlusion
![](.images/main_input_diffuseambientlight.gif)
This dampens indirect diffuse light, such as light probes, indirect light, and diffuse ambient light



---

### Specular Ambient Occlusion
![](.images/main_input_specularambientlight.gif)
This dampens indirect specular light, such as reflection probes, and specular ambient light



---

### Custom Lighting
![](.images/main_input_customlighting.gif)
This input is active when your shader is set to unlit, allowing you to define custom lighting behaviour. The nodes you put here are per-light.



---

### Opacity
![](.images/main_input_alpha.gif)
Opacity controls the transparency of the final pixel. Note that partial transparency is generally finicky to get right, especially when using deferred rendering.



---

### Opacity Clip
![](.images/main_input_alphaclip.gif)
Opacity Clip is a way of controlling if the current pixel/fragment should draw or not. Always use Opacity Clip for objects that need transparency, but not partial transparency, as Opacity Clip is easily sorted, which Opacity is not.



---

### Refraction
![](.images/main_input_refraction.gif)
Refraction is a screen-space UV offset for refracting the background pixels. Make sure you set the alpha to something below 1 before using, so that the refraction effect is visible.



---

### Outline Width
![](.images/main_input_outlinewidth.gif)
This will add an outline to your shader, rendered as an offset mesh with reversed face normals. Note that hard edges will break the outline.



---

### Outline Color
![](.images/main_input_outlinecolor.gif)
This controls the color of the outline.



---

### Vertex Offset
![](.images/main_input_vertexoffset.gif)
This can be used to animate shaders over time, or change the shape of the object in various conditions. You simply insert a XYZ coordinate for how much each vertex should be offset.



---

### DX11 Displacement
![](.images/main_input_displacement.gif)
This works very much in the same way as Vertex Offset, but is used in conjunction with DX11 tessellation. (Note that DirectX is Windows only, requires a DX11 GPU and has to be enabled in Unity)



---

### DX11 Tessellation
![](.images/main_input_tessellation.gif)
This controls how many subdivisions you want to split your triangles into. (Note that DirectX is Windows only, requires a DX11 GPU and has to be enabled in Unity)
